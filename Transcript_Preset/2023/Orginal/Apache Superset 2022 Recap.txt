 Welcome everybody and welcome everybody else trickling in this is a recap of superset in 2022 and I wanted to start off by just making up our quick introductions here. My name is Evan Rusakis. I'm a developer advocate. I'm a superset PMC member and I work for preset and I'm a front-end engineer typically former designer and just interested in all sorts of different stuff. I'll pass over yeah and I'm a mokrg. I've been a dev-rel engineer here at preset almost coming up to a year now prior to this I was mostly made engineer. Didn't really work with the superset project but it was familiar with Apache by Spark and all of that so it was cool to come in and see the most popular pride that Apache has to offer. And I think the next slide I'll also just be covering this for the one person that says they don't know what superset is. So just quickly superset is an open source next slide please. Thank you. It's all good. So superset is an open source BI platform it works with nearly any SQL-speaking data engine and offers a large diversity of charts to create dashboards and visualize your data and since this is a preset event a next slide. Since this is a preset event we're just going to plug preset really quick. What is preset? Preset Cloud is multi workspace Cloudhosted superset with all of the capabilities of superset. We layer on the sock to compliance. We provide end user documentation. Provide various controls like RoVase access control single sign on enterprise support and we offer a managed embedded SDK preset next slide. And then preset managed private cloud is presets BI platform for AWS private cloud with all the same capabilities as a preset cloud with addition to support. And so if you'd like to learn more about preset please visit our website but that's not what we're here to do today really we're here to talk about the community event and the year in review for superset. So community matters what's new that you have access to as open source users and contributors to superset. The agenda today is to recap some stats from 2022 and some of the major achievements in terms of the project. And then we want to look forward a little bit into this year that we've just kicked off and how we're setting and tracking some of our goals. And then we want to open the floor for Q&A at dance or reserve you know 10 or 15 minutes. First off major achievement in terms of supersets popularity and we've reached 50,000 stars I'm getting now this is an interesting kind of vanity statistic you might say it a lot of people star a project on GitHub for a lot of different reasons that might be that you want to contribute to it you want to use it you're just interested in tracking the activity of it. Who knows we don't know everybody's motivations but 50,000 stars is a lot more than almost any Apache project and more than a whole lot of projects out there in the world. So it's a big thing if we look a little closer to those stars it's kind of interesting that the number of stars per month is remaining pretty steady don't mind the little dip in the end of December there that just happens at the holidays periodically it seems. And if you look at the people who have created those stars on GitHub and what organizations they're affiliated with on GitHub you get this little bubble chart here so those seem to be the orgs that are paying attention to superset which is kind of interesting in its own right. Now as far as global additional repo kind of macro trends on the repo it's worth looking at these we are to talk about stars these are accruals so you know additional people starring and working and watching month over month the forks one is great to see the remaining study because these are people that may be either deploying superset and customizing it or they may be people that are looking to develop and contribute to superset or all sorts of different stuff but these are typically people that are remaining very involved with the project. Watchers are going down month over month for some reason I'm not sure exactly what's behind that but I'd love to hear your theories of the avenue and then as far as actual activity on the repo there's GitHub issues and get APIs and compared to 2021 there are a lot fewer issues that were opened which is fantastic having few urges is a good thing it means the product is maturing and stable at least that's the way I'm interpreting this and as you can see the closure rate here is a little less in turn in 2022 but it's worth pointing out that for both issues and PRs these are the issues that were opened in 2022 but the closure stat is up to date so as of yesterday this is the percentage of 2021 issues that are now closed and the percentage of 2022 issues that are now closed so that means we still have 2021 issues that are open and need tending to so we'll talk more about how you can get involved with that later but the number of issues overall on the repo is dropping which is a fantastic thing we're hoping to see that number go down and down over time so yeah lots of stuff going on there in terms of full requests people actually contributing code to the project there was a little bit less than the prior year in terms of PRs what does that mean exactly it's hard to say because you know the lines of code number of PRs number of commits things like that they're good indicators that the project is really busy but they're not necessarily a fantastic measure of progress it's hard to measure engineering success in terms of these sorts of things but there's a lot of stuff happening in supersets code base and that's the important takeaway also on the GitHub repository I wasn't sure if everybody's aware of this but GitHub discussions are becoming more and more of a thing you can see that it's this trending upward and we're happy to see that we're trying to make it so the get up issues are basically bug reports and if you have other things that are sort of Q&A topics or feature requests or design suggestions things like that those can go into ideas forum or Q&A forum or things like that so please check out the discussions and then Slack, I should be sure if you'd like to talk about this. Yes so the superset Slack community has began nearly doubled this year from 5500 at the start of the year to about 8500 members and if you're interested in seeing our 2021 recap we started at around 2500 members and we grew that to 5500 so next slide and the following metrics also doubled or more so weekly active members we started with about 300 at the start of 2022 to about 600 at the end of 2022 and what you see there is our spikes in activity by our active members usually around superset events so some sort of a new release or feature and similarly weekly active members posting messages also grew from about 50 at the start of 2022 to 125 at the end of 2022 so we're excited to see that our Slack is growing and we're leaving to hope we're hoping to leave a few of your questions on answer. Then as far as a Slack users go it's worth pointing out that we do have a few folks in the community that have been doing an awful lot of work there and I want to recognize that achievement. These are people from different organizations and different roles in the community and we really love to see this kind of diversity in in terms of who's helping out on Slack answering questions and all sorts of stuff so please join the crowd if you have the time and inclination and then if you do want to do so these are the front runner Slack channels which tend to be the places you should jump in and help and as you can see beginner questions is you know near the top in terms of messages posted and people actually there a lot of folks post all sorts of questions in these channels so if you are someone that uses or deploys or maintains superset we'd love to get you involved and help answer some of these questions to unblock people in the community and keep them more involved as well. Then overall project maturity it's worth pointing out that in superset 2022 they were a lot of releases we're going to go into these in a second but also these releases are getting used a lot as you can see by these downloads to 615 now the releases that came out you can get all of the info on these from both the release page on the repo as well as the change log if you want to look the individual bits of code via PRs that went into them I should have mentioned earlier but there's going to be a lot of QR tags in these slides so you don't have to go typing long URLs if you have the technology to just to just grab those but these are the six releases that came out in 2022 and we use a semantic versioning on our project now so superset 2.0 was a major release which means there were some breaking changes that came out and but we've also been providing long-term support for the 1.x in our case 1.5 releases as well and 2.0.1 is the newest patch released for superset 2.0 and this is a really important one for a number of reasons a ton of bug fixes went into this because it was a long time after 2.0 was released before we were able to put out a patch release so there's a slew of bug fixes here and a lot of those were actually security patches that are very important and many of these were recently backported to 1.5 so if you're still on 1.5 you will want to upgrade to the latest patch version there but this also gives a lot of people the opportunity to jump in upgrade to 2.0 since that is much more stable much more secure now and we'll talk about future releases later in the presentation but if you want to read all the details about 2.0.1 and what kind of configuration changes you might need to make and things like that there's a blog post and all about that you can check out. In the community we have a whole bunch of new folks joining us in an official capacity so we have committers and PMC members on the project these are our two new committers Diego and Steven as of 2022 and committers are basically people that can merge PRs officially review code they can triage issues and PRs and add labels on the repo things like that and then we also have some people that have been upgraded to PMC which means the project command product project management committee and these these folks were voted in to help manage the project that large including security issues and other procedural things they have binding votes if we're looking for Apache consensus on projects stuff like that so welcome to all of them and all those people are on Slack I should say by the way feel free to reach out to PMC and committers as well as becoming one in case anyone's curious about how that works in 2022 we publish brand new guidelines on what it should take where we're setting the bar on becoming a committer on the project or becoming a PMC member once you're a committer so feel free to read up on that it's also worth noting that you can of course be a contributor to superset without being a committer we take PRs and issues and all that stuff from anyone so please jump on in all right and now the juicy stuff we want to get into some selected highlights of new features and things that were built into superset during the 2022 year there's a blog post about this same kind of presentation that has a longer bullet list we're not going to go into everything here but we want to cover what you can kind of see so hand it over to ShriShin. Yep so superset has added three new supported databases to its list of supported database connections but just remember that superset works with nearly any SQL speaking data engine as long as that database has a Python db API driver and a SQL alchemy dialect and if if those two requirements are met you can go ahead and put up the official support yourself for that database or if you're not technical enough maybe put it into like an ideas thread on GitHub and request it someone who knows what they're doing can do that for you about couch. Right. Coincidentally enough somebody just opened a PR to add a new database to the quiver so that's great and so superset also has an embedded SDK we won't get too much into that same touch and subscribe to our newsletter we'll have an event where we really demo how to get started with embedding your dashboards but in the meantime you can read more about the SDK at this link itself and I'm just going to also copy paste it or anyone who didn't want to scan that QR code. As you can see by the npm download stats it's getting more popular this is becoming much much more of a topic on GitHub and Slack conversations as well so if you're using it or would like to use it please jump in and we'll all find their way. Okay getting into some more sort of features view as table is a new feature we added to dashboards so as you can see you just click that contextual menu click view as table and now you can see all of the data points in tabular format with searchability that underlie your chart it's just kind of the raw data in vanilla format then beyond that we added drill to detail and it's worth noting that this is behind a drill to detail feature flag but the idea here is that you can click or right click rather parts of your chart so in this case we're illustrating this with a pie chart where you can click a certain wedge and when you right click that it opens up the table of much more granular data and it applies a filter for the part of the chart that you clicked and selected so this should allow people to gather a lot more insight of what's beyond the chart you see on the page in terms of granularity but actually this screenshot that I have here is a little bit outdated because we also have this new toy that is now implemented in plus in 2022 implemented in the drill to detail feature which is a new table component and this is built around ant d which is our react component library that we're using for building all sorts of stuff in superset but this table supports all the new bells and whistles you know client server side pagination virtualization cell and header renderers sort of all resizable columns all the bells and whistles and that's in the drill to detail feature now but also coming soon and lots of other areas of superset and another new component you're going to see in a lot of places is this metadata bar component which will give you a lot of contextual information around superset objects like your charts and your dashboards to see who made them and when and where they belong and that is used in a lot of places like the new cross references you'll be seeing between charts and dashboards so a lot of times you'll want to know in which dashboards is this particular chart I'm looking at used so this will help you kind of consider when these things are important and you might not want to be editing or deleting them and all sorts of other ways of kind of finding your way around when you're using superset day-to-day both those components and more in the future are going to be part of the new burgeoning superset design system and what this really is is a big effort to provide systematic well-documented components to developers and these components are following all the new best practices around current patterns and standards and testing and styling and all that good stuff and you'll be hearing off a lot more about this in the blog post and probably a meetup coming soon to explain the whole concept but for right now you can read a little bit about it and look at these new components and actually test them out in a variety of different contexts by looking at supersets react storybook which you can run locally if you're developer but also there's a public-based instance behind this QR code or URL and on this one over yeah so RLS for SQL lab is a brand new feature as well so just quickly a level security is something that enables you to use group membership or like an execution context to control access to rows into database tables to put simply like a manager might be able to select star view all of their employees personal pay information and employing themselves might not be able to select star view you know that kind of data so superset now has support for rural-level security in SQL lab security in superset itself is handled by Flask app builder which is an application development framework built on top of Flask and it provides the authentication user management or permissions and rules so setting data access a rules is much simpler in preset which is the top left screenshot that you're seeing there the data access configuration UI is something that's exclusive to preset but those configurations are identical to what you would see in the Flask app builder for superset the actual RLS configuration UI will be the same for both superset and preset which is what you see in the bottom right and before I forget here is the link where since this is a superset event you can read more about the superset security data. Fabian I did see you're right away we're going to have a queue and we're going to have time for queue in at the end so that's a that's a question I'd rather explain out loud than just type in the answer to other folks are welcome to add questions to you yeah well we'll have time for it okay the visualization picker and superset got a few updates one obvious one being the speech or tag which really tells you these are kind of the latest greatest charts that follow all the best practices and these will be supported for a while very actively by the community there's a couple of other things added here like you can actually deprecate a chart meaning removing it from this view if you're in the straighter of the superset deployment and there's a couple other little things we threw in like better fuzzy search in this area and more examples thumbnails things like that and the ability when you're adding a new chart to just double click the icon which is super handy instead of looking for that create but this is a fun one to smooth out the user experience in the explorer tool that we added a quickvis switcher so these are the top most used visualizations and when you're creating a chart you can very quickly change different types of charts and what really makes that feature useful is a whole bunch of back end work here that went into safer and smoother visualization switching so when you fill out your form data in this control panel to create a chart and then you want to switch charts it used to be that it would just nuke all of that control panel data but now we actually keep track of everything in kind of a big object so if you if you have some settings set that are for one particular chart and you move away from it and you come back it will restore those settings also things like metrics and dimensions are you know normalized and denormalized when moving from chart to chart so it will keep the appropriate settings as best it's able so we hope this makes it much smoother and less frustrating to explore different types of visualizations when you're creating stuff then also a smoother flow in terms of UX is a new way of jumping directly from a SQL app query right into chart creation when you click this button you immediately now start creating a chart and when you go and save that chart is when you'll be creating a data set instead of requiring a data set creation upfront so this not only smooths out the procedure of just getting right to where you want to be but also prevents you from cluttering your super set workspace with a bunch of unneeded data sets that we use for exploratory purposes and also smoothing things out in terms of cognitive load when moving from dashboard into explore is that now if you have a theme applied to your dashboard you'll not only see consistency in serious data for example ships is yellow here and ships is yellow here on two different charts in the same dashboard but when you go and look at one of these individual charts in the explore tool it brings in that color palette that was used on the dashboard you're coming from and everything remains consistent so you can kind of you know skew your thinking when you are suddenly drawingly move to a different color palette horizontal filter bar we talked about embedded for a second but this is a very commonly requested feature that people wanted in their embedded use cases but also a lot of people are really enjoying it for just day to day user experience as well but this little gear button here you click that and you can choose whether you want your native filters dashboard native filters that is to be displayed vertically or horizontally and if there's too many to fit in this row they go into that little overflow menu and just so so please give it a try that's behind a future flag as well for now business types or advanced types some people call them this is a kind of a lot to gloss over in a minute here but the idea is that the column model has been extended so that you can give a column of data a business type the superset is now shipping with IP addresses and ports as initial examples of this but you can develop your own and pardon the firm on this little window and so in this case for example if you were to type an IP address in this format it actually gets converted into a different data format that will then apply to your ad hoc filters and other queries behind the scenes and it also includes validation methods to make sure that what you're typing maps to the underlying format so you can create one sort of format that relates to another and this that definitely helps when you have different tables from different data sources that use different formats of the same thing you can read up a lot more on that if you track if you look up sub 78 the handlebars chart is a new thing as well this is a little bit of a beta beta this plugin you might call it there's still a few quirks we're working it out it's getting better by the day and there will be a blog post coming about the intricacies of all of this soon but the idea is that you can map your data to a bit of handlebars templating and HTML in this plugin and you can also add fairly arbitrary CSS styling to it so really what can you do with this is there a couple of very basic examples creating here sort of an and on chart to kind of say you know red bad green good for a particular data point you can also create custom tables really anything you want that's HTML based that can just kind of map through your data there's common helpers built in for map operations and you know use dynamic background images or emoji or whatever you want skyse the line you can even do SVG tags if you want to get super crazy with things but yeah try it out it's very very interesting it opens a lot of doors for those that are not finding the plugin they want to do simple display things generic x-axis this is also behind a feature flag called generic chart axes and the idea here is that we wanted to take some of the newer charts particularly e-charts ones that were called time series charts and make them not specifically time series so now you can actually add a categorical x-axis to a lot of different chart types line charts area charts bar charts that sort of thing so instead of there being the time section that used to be in this part of the controls when you have this feature flag turned on it's gone it's no longer relevant because now you can drop a time column in here or you can drop a dimension in here with categorical information and your chart will work and along with that a getting rid of the time section which was largely used for time range filtration we've now moved time range filters into the ad hoc filter section which not only gives it a new home but adds additional capability where you can add more than one ad hoc temporal filter here so you might want to filter you know a data set to maybe have one filter for a shib don date and one filter for a received on date so you can find the shipments that fit both those requirements just as a random example and now we'll go ahead and look ahead to 2023 a little bit we're not going to go into too many specific features here but just a little bit of the process of how we're thinking about these changes coming up and how you might be able to kind of get some context on those and get involved if you're so inclined which we strongly encourage we do have new releases coming up 2.0.2 is in the works right now if reach out to Man's lack if you have anything that you're clamoring to get in there but it's basically another patch release so bug fixes security fixes that sort of thing we hope to have a 2.1 release which would be a new cutoff of master so that those running the 2.0 which is current release will get additional features that have been on the repo in recent months and then coming up as many people have asked about is the 3.0 release the next major release which according to the synatic versioning thing means we can bring in some breaking changes that should might be getting rid of old charts or removing some feature flags and things like that so if you want to get involved with 3.0 what it is what it might be you can check out this project board that's on the get repo which is where we're going to be kind of capturing puzzles for a lot of these changes and these will be brought to the Apache mailing list and Slack channels and everything else for discussion and consensus to officially carry some of these individual tasks into the release and if you want to make requests for the 3.0 release that should be you know kind of bite size since we want to get this out probably release spring then you can drop them in this discussion thread here since most people don't have the privileges to modify the project board itself we're not going to guarantee anything making it in these are just requests but feel free to drop those also in terms of projects that may or may not be part of the 3.0 thing we just started a the humble beginnings of a super set community roadmap another project where we're just kind of tracking some of the the big moves not granular tasks but in larger initiatives that are taken on by individuals or organizations that are working on super set and each of these has a little bit of information like the relevant Slack channel relevant sit for super set improvement proposal or other documentation and synchronous meetings things like that that you can get involved with as mentioned the super set improvement proposals a lot of these are also being tracked here some of them are taking place right now in terms of kind of long tail changes that we're making in the product and some of them are being proposed right now so you might want to look through those that are in discussion and you're also able to open your own if you want to make and come to own a larger change in the super set product and then if you want to get involved in any or all of this stuff I wanted to expose people to what we're calling the super set operational model there's going to be a blog post coming out in just a couple of days about this really but the idea is that we have these town hall events where everybody in the community is welcome to come and kind of talk about the development of the project and these community discussions that have an on get up and slack and everywhere else are proposed as agenda items into a big Google document that we take to town hall we all sit down and talk about it and figure out how we can break it into actionable chunks which are then handed off to working groups like security developer experience you know and those working groups have their own processes slack channels meetings and so forth that you're welcome to get involved with like if you want to talk about releases go to the release meeting and those actions and discussions are brought back to the next town hall for everybody to know kind of where we're at so it's a bit of a cycle and that you're more than welcome to participate and all of the tasks that are happening in those working groups hopefully all of them at least the the noteworthy ones are taking place on this get them projects you can track those as well more ways to get involved if you're not already please check out the super set community calendar that includes meetups like this one it includes those town halls and all sorts of other events that the super set community is welcome and encourage to take part in there's the superset slack you can generate a QR code for this because it's just a redirect from bitly but please join if you haven't already and get involved in some of those channels we can use more voices then of course get a bit of issues not only are you welcome to file them if you have issues and bugs you're running into but we would really appreciate the support and cleanup going through the giant list of the ones we have today and we can use validation we could use all sorts of support question answering since jump in and same with get a discussion if you see something you don't like about superset or you have a fantastic idea for it or whatever we would love to hear that so drop your ideas there and last but not least a Q&A so now that we've gone on for a little while we can open the floor to you guys to hear really any questions you'd like but these are some example topics that we'd love to hear about in case you're so inclined so with that I'll stop sharing and so I can take the first question I saw in the Q&A Fabian asked how can I connect the view to a database so please provide clarification what I'm assuming here is you're talking about a virtual table or view within superset so what that is is it's essentially a sequel query that's running against your target database you are creating a new data set now if you want to productionize that or you know that that's something that you're going to reuse what you want to do is make it available as a data set to superset so what I mean by that is create this data set in your database layer itself or have this transformation because at the end of the day a virtual view or a virtual data set in superset isn't a materialized view it's not a real data set it's a sequel query you are rerunning every time you refresh that I hope I answered that question so I'm going to just click answer live there I also saw one I think it was pre-need to ask how about couch base I don't I've never heard of couch base if there is a Python database API driver and it has a sequel alchemy dialect it will work I promise you that if it's something you're interested in seeing as like officially supported and appearing somewhere in the superset documentation that's what all of those resources were for but that's how you would get that up there and I see does preset superset have fed ramp certification for running in the guv clouds in AWS and Azure I don't think so I don't think so I haven't heard anything about fed ramp would you have socket I think fed ramp is another level over sock to I'm just talking about this from my prior experience I know in the sock to compliance that mark if you're interested in speaking to someone on our sales team happy to touch for the idea yeah that I personally don't think so but we can find out for you do have some other governments that are using it so it's can say that and if you guys don't mind just please use the q&a tab around the chat yeah somebody's having trouble adding the calendar I don't know if anybody else had success with that generally seems to work strangely you had to you have to be logged into a google account to actually add it to your own personal calendar but it should be public and if you're having an issue I'm not quite sure what it is I'm sorry to say I do see I hope I'm saying it yeah kube jacob thanks for the presentation are embedded dashboards a feature or of preset or superset if the dashboard is embedded do the users of my application have the option to modify again depending on how you set up the RLS and what kind of permissions those viewers have they can be just viewers they might be just getting reports you can control all of that permissioning on your own we're just going to throw in another quick preset plug preset can manage all of that for you and superset it's a much more manual process you're going to be doing those controls yourself but at the end of the day it's how you embed that application it's a feature for both preset and superset it's just easier and preset because we are on an image solution I hope that answered that I do see someone say presenters usually lock the chat for themselves and use q&a for the audience that's true but I like having the chat open so audience can do everybody yes nice dear some of the little comments somebody said things the temporal filters and that's cool to hear because I it doesn't feel like we're just talking to you know each other here we see like people actually typing I believe I answered that yeah I think that question about connecting you to the database was answered if there's a particular nuance to that that you'd like to cover we can yeah can you address backup and restore I find exporting is the best way so far oh so actually what I can do is provide you with a link to a blog post that I wrote sometime back about managing your dashboards as assets using code control so I get home you can find out a little bit about that yes exporting is a way but using the superset CLI or the preset we also have our own CLI you came to source control all of your dashboards so let me just find a link to that really quick because that is a pretty common question actually that comes up so this was just an example this is from Mark's question I'm gonna I'll put the link in the chat I did say answer live but here you know it's called dashboards delivering dashboards is coded a lot of people tend to back up their metadata database as well just for good measure because that's just yeah safe then is there a blog that discusses deploying superset in an enterprise environment for multi-tenancy if you find one would love to read it no I have not written one of those but I'm sure they exist there's actually quite a few people that cover it in different ways I mean people decline superset in different ways using different technology multi-tenant or not with different types of custom security managers and authentication and all sorts of things so that's a whole universe of stuff onto its own but if anyone is looking for I got to say an easy way to use you know multi-tenant superset and a scalable version of things that's that happens to be what we do a preset so yeah free to try out and then have I understood it well all new releases of new versions are under preset and not superset ones I yeah you take you yeah so actually what preset does is decoupled from the official Apache releases of superset preset tends to well we have a lot of fantastic QA resources and so forth so we tend to be much closer to master than the official releases so we've kind of put out the latest and greatest stuff with some additional layers of customization and enhancement the official superset releases are are done by really anyone on the PMC that could be from any organization but I admit preset tends to do a lot of them and the idea here is that we just want to kind of provide these ongoing open source releases periodically to the community just to keep all of those semantic versioning or send for policies in place so we can have windows of opportunity to provide breaking changes on the repo and then you know follow up with those major releases with feature releases and patch releases as well so yeah superset releases and preset releases are pretty different animals we don't release the superset releases every set we do around and there is a release strategy working group that's on that community calendar if anybody wants to go into the details of all that so this is the can't see all the questions I'm not quite sure you should be able to see them in the answered section yeah yeah if I'm talking too fast or too quietly hopefully when this is posted on YouTube you know you can kind of I hope I I'm pretty sure I read each question out loud so it should be there I'll put chapters on the youtube link if that helps oh I maybe I skipped one I'm not sure let's see I read it out loud in the past too so we're good to go how do you change databases for a dashboard I know you can change data sets very easily in explore for a particular chart this person wants to oh I can do do I can answer that how do you how do you change databases for a dashboard you have there's a settings tab so this is this is all going to be so we're talking about superset specifics here you just have to add a new database connection if you have this dashboard so this is a particular issue though because your data sets are going to be identified differently so my advice rather than trying to change up the entire underlying database if you have like a QA portion and like a production portion just create them in separate environments but you can you would you have to do a lot of rewiring and making sure that database name or the data set names themselves align your because your queries will break the queries powering all the charts so that's like a decision you kind of have to make when you're starting to create this dashboard that was a Peter's question about changing a database for dashboard yes if there's any links to the handlebars charts shown in the example earlier not yet but very soon that's actually something I'm going to be working on starting tomorrow honestly to put some of these examples and some new ones hopefully on hubgift and then put all of that into a blog post to kind of explain what makes them tick what the limitations are peculiarities and all of that yeah I hope to go deep and explain better how to use the handlebars chart going forward someone asks about does the preset starter package offer the user the ability to publish and deploy dashboards to the web the depends on what you mean by publishing deployed to the web I mean if you if you have sufficient seats on your account yes anyone with an account can log in and look at the dashboards if you mean embedding I don't know exactly what how tears affect the embedding feature to be honest neither do do I actually own that one that that would be a better question for our sales team there yeah we can put you in touch with someone just reach out to either of us on Slack and connect you then any links oh do you have a link to the handlebars chart well you said there's going to be a blog so yeah there's going to be I'm going to I'm going to write a nice long post for anybody that wants to play with it with kind of a you know beginner to advanced tutorial there's some more new color groups for visualization I don't know well that's so there's again not trying not trying to get this to community if you are able to modify your code based add additional color palettes bake it in on your deployment if you want to customize that way otherwise if you happen to be a preset user then there is a feature to add additional custom color palettes at a certain pricing tier so that's something we offer to be more dynamic and less of a developer feature is there cool so is there a way to export and import reports yeah I believe so like report reporting should be automatic so you can I'll just try to I'll just leave you to the documentation on that that's not something I specifically have worked with so I don't know the mechanics behind that but I do believe that it is possible not curious maybe somebody can answer in the chat did anyone use those QR codes or those I did not see the poll oh no I didn't see it I actually the poll we got a 23% yes 73% no three I don't think it all right it's not always to download that for his PDF that's a fantastic question I don't think you can expect it but we would welcome it this is one of those areas where it might be a great idea to put that on get up discussions as an ideas thread and see how many other people are willing to kind of back it figure out where the edges of that feature are and if there's any design implications that need to be dealt with there and then you know currently it's not slated on the roadmap but if anyone has the inclination to open some PRs around it we obviously that's sort of future somebody just added some excel spreadsheet exporting stuff for charts for example you know these things do come from the community so I would love to see it this is just a written can the audience see the answer tab by any chance in our Q&A you can just use the chance oh okay thank you so one person can't see the answer for someone no or in the future video I'll make sure the questions are for those who can't see it they're just of course just to make sure it's there is a Q&A button in your toolbar that pops up in the separate window sorry that's one of those tech support is it plugged in questions but see that oh we got another you add table as CS we can yeah you can already effectively do that and explore you can download the data from there Frederick's question how often can you auto update and refresh a superset dashboard you can actually I'm pretty sure it goes down to like the seconds you can just pick your cash intervals like even less than a second if you want I'm actually trying to work on a semi-real time dashboard right hopefully with this it'll all be your caching settings if you want to see that or talk about it I'm happy to do in the right direction all right seems like we're slowing down on questions so about 10 minutes feel free to ask oh I also our blog post just got published about drill down so maybe now it's a good time to do that yeah so what okay a blog post apparently just went out about drill to details which is a step along the way I think I'm gonna read another blog post that goes a little bit more into where drilling operations and superset in general are going but where we're at right now is drill to details so from a particular you know bar on a bar chart or whatever you can right click and you could say drill to detail and that'll add a filter for the bar you clicked for example the next thing we want to do is what we're calling drill by so if you right clicked a bar on a bar chart you would then get the option to drill by wherein you pick another dimension or column and so you would essentially filter by the bar you click and then it would group by the dimension that you select and we haven't built that yet that's just in planning right now but that's kind of the next step along the way to what most people call drill down where drill down the distinction is that you have an imposed hierarchy so it might be you know state cities and those hierarchical relationships have to be managed at the semantic layer and we don't have that feature right now but we actually believe that the drill by feature I was just describing scratches that edge and more so it actually is a more flexible option than the traditional drill down so I'm already getting long winded here but there will be a we have drill to detail which is fantastic now you can read about it and a lot more drilling operations are on the road map and you'll be hearing more about that future in much greater detail and blog post meetups and so forth thank you too Jerry question thank you bye unless there are any last minute questions we can give everyone their seven up here we go drill to details a feature flag where's the best place to find these flags stuff uh okay I can tell you that so in the repo there is a feature flags MD which I believe is stashed one direct reddit but we get the correct we have the cover my but yeah I could take a moment and find that but yeah there is a feature flags MD that breaks them down into categories and those categories are like whether it's in development or if it's kind of in beta testing or if it's effectively deprecated yes so in the resources here I'm going to share my screen probably there's this feature flags MD file within resources and in here you can see what's essentially in the works what's in testing what we've deemed stable and deprecated once so for the 3.0 effort we're actually going to be taking a pass at all of these and making sure not only is this up to date but where we want it to be going into the next major version really so we'll probably remove a few feature flags probably flip a few of them to be default true instead of false or vice versa I hope that helps and would you mind dropping that link in the chat just just for anyone who might work for a few years so there you go nice well I hope we'll just talk really slowly in case more questions coming in the next five minutes but I hope everyone got something out of that thanks Evan for doing most of the talking here oh and one last question a blog post about annotation layers that's an interesting topic I haven't written one that's not a bad one to write about not a bad idea at all yeah that's another feature that kind of needs a bit of a revisit in terms of user experience it's not the simplest thing to approach but yeah there's a lot of content to go into there so that's a good idea in the meantime what I could do is I'll just plug some more pre-set documentation about annotations if that helps but we can we can definitely keep it in on our radar to write about this since there's interest about this topic going once going twice all right everybody have a good one bye
