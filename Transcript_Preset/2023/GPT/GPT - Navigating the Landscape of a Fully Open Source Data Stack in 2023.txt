So here, pointing out to Preset, my company that commercializes or offers a managed service around Apache SuperSet. Here on the vendor side has been extremely dynamic with things like Tableau, Power BI, Looker. You know, there's been acquisitions in the space, very, very dynamic space. There's a lot of innovation. And that's, you know, I believe there are people who make a living off comparing these tools. So here I'm not gonna go too deep and try to nudge you into taking a look at Apache SuperSet that's really competitive in the space against even the leading vendors. So go open source.

I believe the last section I have, and I'm trying to save time for some Q&A here, is the data workspace and notebooks area. These REPL interactive coding environments are extremely powerful and can be a really good model to do analytics, data science, data transformation. Personally, I love firing up just a Jupyter notebook and working from a notebook, especially when working with larger datasets and data frames. So extremely powerful.

I'll talk about the commercial side. I think Hex has created a really interesting product in this space. The fact that it's a hosted notebook as opposed to say Jupyter that's running on your laptop or on a VM somewhere adds a social dimension, collaboration dimension, which is really awesome and powerful.

Talking about things like Google's got Google Colab, a lot of the tools that are built here are built on top of Jupyter, or at least respecting or trying to follow the Jupyter standard. Things like Databricks, SageMaker, Azure Notebooks sometimes are portal to underlying infrastructure. So say in the context of Databricks, you're in the Databricks notebook, but you can fire up these Spark jobs and take advantage of the entire Databricks ecosystem and data platform. So in some ways, these notebooks on the commercial side are a gateway to infrastructure and tooling and frameworks. That's powerful.

What I wanted to say on the open source side is you can get a lot of mileage out of just a hosted notebook, right? It's pretty easy to fire up a VM on an EC2 instance and fire up a Jupyter kernel and work from that. So it's nice to have a hosted notebook solution, but it's also pretty easy to get by with just using Jupyter, JupyterHub, things like NBViewer if you want to publish your notebooks as static assets. So there's a lot you can do with a very, very rich ecosystem.

And as I approach the timer, clock limit here, I'm gonna wrap up. Stacks are extremely complicated, right? I covered probably just a tenth of the data stack. There is a lot to know. And how you make selections around a stack is pretty critical because when you pick something, it's pretty sticky and it's hard to migrate, right? Once you pick a database, once you pick a workflow engine, it's a lot of work to move from one to the other. So it's really worth the time to make educated decisions on your stack. A good way to do it is to be on listening to talk like this one, is to talk with practitioners, talk to people at places like OSACON, ask them what they love, what they don't like about their current stack, and that can inform your decisions here because those decisions are important.

Luckily, it's a lot easier than it used to be to pick things of your stack into. It's all in run it with all the hosted solutions. So that makes things a little bit easier to get started. And also like note that it's a fair amount of work to glue these things together. So if you pick whatever it may be, if you pick a Airbyte, you know, Starburst, Galaxy, Preset, a handful of other things, there's still a fair amount of work in getting these things to work together. So these hosted services are pretty convenient, so at least you don't have to be on call and run these things and keep them up day and night.

So that's it. And then just happy to see how open source is dynamic and really a strong contender in all of these layers of the stack and beyond. So that's all I got, folks, and I've maybe got half a minute for questions. I'm gonna go and be at one, I said I wanted a table, maybe the visualization table and the lounge if people wanna come and talk to me. I'll be there to take questions. So thank you."
