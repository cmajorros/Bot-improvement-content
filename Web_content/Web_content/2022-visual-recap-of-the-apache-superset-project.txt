The Superset Community has been growing steadily since joining the Apache Software Foundation in 2017. 2022 is no exception to that rule, as the  Superset project and the community surrounding it have continued to grow and mature in a number of ways we're excited to share.

As we publish this, Superset's Github repo has hit the landmark achievement of 50K stars! While this metric is admittedly a little dubious in what it means, a milestone is a milestone! We’re a big deal!
In 2022, the repo had 1963 PRs merged, compared with 2543 in 2021. As any engineer can attest, neither the number of PRs nor lines of code are an ideal measure of progress. The point here isn’t to compare year over year, but to illustrate that the repo continues to move FAST!
In 2021, the community opened 2265 issues, and closed 1683 of them. In 2022, there were 1178 issues opened, and 540 of them were closed. One interpretation of this is that the project is improving in stability (about half the issues overall) but that the community didn’t do as well this year in addressing opened issues - this is an area we can strive to improve in 2023.

The Superset Slack community has again nearly doubled, from ~5500 at the start of the year to ~8600 members! As expected, the following metrics all doubled or more in lock step:
We’re excited to see a growing number of faces in the Slack community, many of whom are growing increasingly engaged in discussions, and leaving fewer and fewer questions unanswered. We hope to see this trend grow as we enter 2023!



2022 had no shortage of important Superset releases. We shipped Superset 2.0, for starters! Along with that major release, we shipped significant minor releases (new features!) and patch releases (fewer bugs!) including:
In particular, we’re excited to cap off the year with our 2.0.1 patch release. This contains a slew of bug fixes and security patches, meaning anyone who’s been waiting to take the leap to Superset 2.0 can now do so more safely and securely than ever. Read more about the 2.0.1 release and why it’s so important.
We want to extend a warm welcome to all those who were voted into the official roster on the Apache Superset project. This brings our count for Committers (who can approve and merge code, essentially) up to 54, and Project Management Committee (PMC) members (with additional responsibilities and a “binding” vote) up to 33!
New Committers: Diego Medina, Stephen Liu
New PMC members: Kamil Gabryjelski, Diego Pucci, Hugh A. Miles II, and Michael Molina
There is SO MUCH in store for 2023 and beoynd, and we’d love to have you involved. If you're not already a part of the Superset community, join us!
Thank you all for for your hard work in helping to grow and support the Superset product and its community. We’ll check back in a year and see how we’ve grown! Meanwhile, we look forward to working with you all in 2023 as we move toward many exciting new frontiers.
