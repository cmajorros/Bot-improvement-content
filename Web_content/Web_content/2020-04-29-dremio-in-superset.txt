Companies are constantly looking for quicker and better solutions to get value out of their data lakes. Oftentimes with many petabytes of data collected, there is undoubtedly a need for a modern toolset to process, query, visualize, and make those data valuable.
At Preset we’re committed to open source, and appreciate that our friends at Dremio maintain a DBAPI-compatible Python database driver and a SQLAlchemy dialect that enables Superset to connect. Better yet, they blogged about connecting the two, so you can follow along to set up the Dremio-Superset combination for your own data lake.
Check it out: Unlocking Advanced Data Analytics on The Data Lake Using Apache Superset and Dremio.
If you prefer to skip all the steps of installing and managing Superset, sign up for a hosted Superset solution provided by Preset (in alpha), connect it with Dremio, and start getting value out of your data right away.
