Data visualization and BI tools are essential for any modern organization to make fast, data-driven decisions. With a wide range of visualization tools available to choose from, it's important to know what makes each platform unique. After Databricks acquired Redash, Metabase and Apache Superset were the last two popular open-source business intelligence platforms left.
Although most BI platforms allow you to create data visualizations, perform complicated data analysis, and build interactive dashboards, open source BI tools offer even more benefits. Whether you're looking for cost effectiveness, customizability, wide-spread community support, enhanced security, or future-proofing features, open source BI is the way to go. And, with that in mind, Apache Superset is the most popular open source BI tool in the world (by Github stars).
In this post, we'll showcase where Metabase shines and struggles in comparison to Preset Cloud / Superset.
Preset's founder and CEO is Max Beauchemin, the original creator of Apache Superset. At Preset, we're the experts of Superset and are proud to be the leading vendor offering Apache Superset as a cloud hosted service. In addition to all of the features that Superset has out of the box, Preset Cloud offers the following:
The Superset community enjoys the benefit of being a project housed in the Apache Software Foundation. The barrier to contributing is low and the Superset community has added support for new databases at a breakneck pace.
 Evaluate popular analytics software tools such as Apache Superset, Tableau, Looker, and more.
Both Metabase and Superset have no-code interfaces for crafting SQL queries.
Business intelligence tools are only as good as the visualizations they enable.
Similar to how the Superset community helped drive support for over 20 databases, they've also been the driving force behind the large array of visualizations in Superset. This is no surprise, since Superset's contributor community is significantly larger than Metabase's.
Both Metabase and Superset ship with a powerful SQL editor and a lightweight semantic layer.
In the no-code chart builder (Explore), metrics, columns, and virtual datasets all inherit the power that physical database tables have in Superset.
Superset is widely known for the beautiful charts and interactive dashboards you can create quickly. Here's an example that's a community favorite:

While you can customize enterprise features on Superset, Preset Cloud makes it easier to configure them from its UI. Below makes the comparison of key enterprise features between Metabase and Preset Cloud.
