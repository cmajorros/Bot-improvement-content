Superset 2.0 is a huge release and big step forward for the open source project in terms of user experience and stability. Superset 2.0:
If you're a customer of either of our managed services for Superset, Preset Cloud or Preset Managed Private Cloud, note that you've had nearly all of these features for a while now. Here at Preset, we test, QA, and deploy the bleeding edge version of Superset (the master branch) every 2 weeks to our customers so they always have the latest and greatest experience.
Enhanced Visualization Switcher
In Explore, the no-code chart building experience, users can switch among the most commonly used visualization types extremely quickly while retaining chosen metrics and dimensions. (#20248)

Horizontal Bar Chart
You can now switch the orientation of a Time-series Bar Chart (v2) visualization from vertical to horizontal! (#19918)

Drag and Drop in Table Charts
The Table visualization now supports drag and drop for column rearrangement, making it easier to customize this chart type. (#19381)
Improvements to Mixed Chart
Mixed charts let you combine multiple charts in a single visualization container. The Mixed Chart visualization now supports Advanced Analytics (#19851), non-time-series x-axis (behind feature flag), and the display of both queries(#20277).
Dataset Filtering Experience
You can now filter datasets in the Datasets list view by their certification status. (#20136)

More consistent results panel
Accessing the results panel for a chart in a Dashboard has a significantly improved user experience, more consistent with what's shown in Explore.
New Jinja Macros
Jinja in Superset got an upgrade! 2.0 introduces the dataset macro, which lets users reference both virtual and physical datasets, as well as their attached calculated columns and metrics. (#15241)
2.0 also introduces the where_in filter, for a better experience defining multiple values (e.g. in a WHERE clause) (#19574):
Lots of Quality of Life Improvements
In quick succession, here are some of the quality of life improvements that Superset users can now enjoy:
Edit Dataset modal now doesn't close when you click away (#20278)
When editing the label in the Metrics popover, pressing Enter now saves what you typed (#19898)
When adding new chart from the dashboard view, the dashboard name will now pre-fill (#20129)
Annotations now have an improved empty state (#20160)
Confirmational modal is now shown if user exits Explore without saving changes (#19993)
Explore popovers now close when the Escape key is pressed (#19902)
Run and Save buttons are redesigned for improved usability (#19558)
Superset 2.0 fixed an immense number of bugs. Here's a preview of some of them:
