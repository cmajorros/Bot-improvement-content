In this post, I will focus on the first three. You can always browse the full changelog on Github. Let's dive in!
Certifiying Charts and Dashboards
Understanding which charts and dashboards are reliable, useful, and up to date is a universal challenge in BI tools. To help address this, you can now certify charts and dashboards and attach your name to it.

This lets other users quickly glean which charts and dashboards can be expected to be maintained and reliable, and even filter down lists to just the certified ones.

Improved Dashboard Layout Capabilities
Tabs in Superset enable dashboards to be more dynamic and help dashboard consumers focus. To expand the capability of tabs, Superset 1.4 adds the ability to add tabs within Columns. Rows and columns are powerful containers in Superset for organizing charts.

More Variables in Jinja Templating
Jinja templating lets you add more dynamic-ness to your dashboards. Superset 1.4 added support for referencing time_grain and time_column variables in your Jinja code.

Parquet Upload
Features like CSV upload enables last-mile data upload for visualization. Superset now supports the upload of Parquet files. You can find out more here.
Alerts & Reports
Alerts & reports in Superset received a few minor upgrades in user experience that make them more readable and digestable.
Superset 1.4 contains the most number of bug fixes in recent history! I will include a sample of end-user facing bug fixes below, but you can see a full list in the changelog.
