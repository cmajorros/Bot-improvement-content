Both Apache Superset and Looker are business intelligence platforms that provide data exploration, data visualization, and reporting capabilities to organizations. They enable users to access, analyze, and visualize information stored in a variety of databases and cloud data warehouses. These platforms also provide collaboration and sharing features, allowing teams to work together to share insights and reports.
While both BI platforms are popular among data analysts, this guide outlines why you might find Superset to be a compelling Looker alternative.
In June 2019, the Looker team announced that they were being acquired by Google. The acquisition resulted in the transition from Google Data Studio to Looker Studio.
This isn't a new phenomenon. Due to the maturity and dynamism of the BI market, consolidation has been accelerating over the past few years:
Acquisitions often carry the risk of shutdowns or reduced investments in the acquired solutions, leaving customers to seek new services for their business analytics assets, which they will likely need to rebuild. Open-source BI applications mitigate this risk. If you're self-hosting an open-source tool, you are immune to vendor lock-in. If you choose to partner with a SaaS or hosted service provider of the open-source software, you will have numerous options, from alternative vendors to hiring expertise in the marketplace, all the way to taking ownership and operating the software on your own.
Apache Superset is the most popular and mature open-source business intelligence platform. This BI tool provides in-depth data exploration functionality for both SQL-savvy technical users and non-technical business users seeking actionable insights for their business.
Below, we compare between Superset and Looker across key dimensions for a BI tool.
While connecting to databases is similar in both tools, Looker requires learning and modeling your data in LookML. This process entails expensive developer licenses and a significant amount of time due to the learning curve and implementation.
Superset allows you to dive straight into data exploration with SQL or drag-and-drop functionality. It also provides a straightforward semantic layer that isn't restricted by user licenses. Superset additionally enables CSV uploads and connections to Google Sheets, making it possible for users to work with data that isn't stored in your data lake / data warehouse without the need for complex workarounds or ETL solutions.
The open-source Superset is, of course, free to install. However, there is an ongoing cost associated with maintaining Superset, which depends on your organization's scale and deployment complexity, ranging from fractional to full-time engineering resources.
If you don't have in-house resources to maintain Superset deployment, you might consider a hosted solution. Preset, a SaaS version of Superset, has no platform fee and offers an affordable user licensing fee of $20 per month. Unlike most BI tools that charge extra for additional capabilities, Preset's standard license includes all functionalities, including admin capabilities, and allows you to restrict functionality as needed.
Preset's standard license is most comparable to Looker's developer user, priced at $150 per month, which can force organizations to limit functionality, creating bottlenecks for the data team or significantly increasing costs and learning requirements. Looker's view-only license is listed at $30 per month and typically includes a platform fee that can start at tens of thousands of dollars per year.”
